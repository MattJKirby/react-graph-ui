# React Graph UI

## Summary

This is a React library the enables the creation and visualisation of interactive node-based flow diagrams. Nodes can be entirely customised, including their edges and anchor points. Graphs exist on a canvas that can be zoomed and scrolled over with help from the d3-zoom and d3-drag JavaScript libraries.

## Why is this a NextJS app??

Quick and dirty! I'll make it nice soon :)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. Next navigate to the '/graphui' route to view the graph component.
